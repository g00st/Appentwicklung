# App Development

## Jobs
  - Jobs will be saved in a database.
  - Jobs should include: start time, end time, total time, time actually used for seeding, and time spent replacing a full plate.
  - Jobs will be immutable from the frontend (once saved, they can only be viewed).
  - Plate configurations are saved as GCODE.

## Machine Control
  - Home the machine.
  - Control movement in X, Y, Z axes and toggle the vacuum pump on and off.
  - Enable/disable motors.
